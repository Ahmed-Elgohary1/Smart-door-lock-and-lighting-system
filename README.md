# Password Validation and Recommendation Tool

This repository contains a password validation and recommendation tool that helps users check the validity of their chosen password and recommends a strong one if their chosen password is weak. 

## Features

- Validates the strength of a chosen password
- Recommends a strong password if the chosen password is weak
- Uses a combination of password strength rules and algorithms to determine the strength of a password
- Checks for factors such as length, complexity, and uniqueness to determine the strength of the password
- Easy to use and integrate into existing applications
- Regularly updated to ensure it remains secure and up-to-date with the latest password security best practices

## Getting Started

To use the password validation and recommendation tool, simply clone the repository and run the tool using your preferred programming language or framework. The tool is designed to be easy to use and integrate into existing applications.

## Usage

To use the tool, simply call the *IsValid()* function and pass in the chosen password as a parameter. The function will return a boolean value indicating whether the password is valid or not. If the password is weak, the function will also recommend a strong password that meets the required strength criteria.
```
password = "myweakpassword"
is_valid = IsValid(password)

if not is_valid:
    printf("Your password is weak. We recommend using a stronger password: %s" , recommend());
else:
    printf("Your password is strong. Good job!");

```
